# Celia Houston Portfolio 
This webpage documents challenges I have completed during my coursework for the Front-End Web Development bootcamp.
I have built this portfolio to showcase my skills and talents, which I can continually update as the course progresses. 
I have used semantic HTML and CSS. I have included CSS Grid layouts, hover elements and media queries for different screen sizes. 
Within the Screencast link below, I have shown the webpage and the webpage for Samsung Galaxy S8+ (360px x 740px)
